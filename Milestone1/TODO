Project

PA7 - switch
PA6 - reset
PC4 - yaw ref


2.0
At the start (spec 5) helicopter should move to yaw ref point. - active HIGH

4.0
Two ouput PWM signals with configurable duty cycle and fixed freq between 150 and 300 Hz.
Main rotor on M0PWM7
Tail rotor on M1PWM5
 - Implemented using motorPower and setPWM.

5.0
SW1 slider switch as state controller. UP is HIGH
DOWN - landing or landed
UP - taking off or flying
Ignore any changes when trying to land. It should land smoothly facing reference position.
Should take off when state is CHANGED from down to up when landed. Should start by turning all rotors on and
rotating to ref position. Initially should be in landed state with all motors off.

6.0
Buttons control flight
UP and DOWN - change altitude by 10% each push. If within 10% of max or min alt,
move to that point and ignore any further pushes in that direction.

LEFT and RIGHT - change angle by 15% each push. (CCW - LEFT, CW - RIGHT).
Buttons should only affect their output, ie UP should not change yaw.

7.0
Push button signals should be asserted for at least 200ms.

8.0
Operation of the RESET button calls the SysCtlReset() in driverlib/sysctl.h

9.0
Should have realtime foreground/background kernel on round robin basis. Robust behaviour at all times.

10.0
Flight should be controlled by PI or PID controller.

11.0
Information on rotor duty cycles, altitude, yaw and state should be transmitted via UART.
No less than 4Hz.
