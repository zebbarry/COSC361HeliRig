Project

PA7 - switch
PA6 - reset
PC4 - yaw ref
PC5 - Main Rotor
PF1 - Tail Rotor


2.0
At the start (spec 5) helicopter should move to yaw ref point. - active HIGH

4.0
Two ouput PWM signals with configurable duty cycle and fixed freq between 150 and 300 Hz.
Main rotor on M0PWM7
Tail rotor on M1PWM5
 - Implemented using motorPower and setPWM.

5.0
SW1 slider switch as state controller. UP is HIGH
DOWN - landing or landed
UP - taking off or flying
Ignore any changes when trying to land. It should land smoothly facing reference position.
Should take off when state is CHANGED from down to up when landed. Should start by turning all rotors on and
rotating to ref position. Initially should be in landed state with all motors off.

6.0
Buttons control flight
UP and DOWN - change altitude by 10% each push. If within 10% of max or min alt,
move to that point and ignore any further pushes in that direction.

LEFT and RIGHT - change angle by 15% each push. (CCW - LEFT, CW - RIGHT).
Buttons should only affect their output, ie UP should not change yaw.

7.0
Push button signals should be asserted for at least 200ms.

8.0
Operation of the RESET button calls the SysCtlReset() in driverlib/sysctl.h

9.0
Should have realtime foreground/background kernel on round robin basis. Robust behaviour at all times.

10.0
Flight should be controlled by PI or PID controller.

11.0
Information on rotor duty cycles, altitude, yaw and state should be transmitted via UART.
No less than 4Hz.



---------- STATES ----------
Landed:
 - Motors off and set with duty cycles of 5%
 - Checking for SW going HIGH
 - Ignoring buttons and leaving desired angle as is and height at 0.

---> SW goes HIGH
Taking Off:
 - Turn all motors on and set duty cycles to hover.
 - Set desired angle to zero and rotate until hitYawRef is true then stop.
 - Ignore buttons and leave desired height and angle at 0.
 
---> hitYawRef goes HIGH
Flying:
 - Poll buttons to update desired height and angle by 10% and 15 deg.
 - If at max or min height do not go further.
 - Calculate yaw and height error.
 - Continually update motor PWM using updateMotors with the error.

 ---> SW goes LOW
 Landing:
 - Ignore SW and button changes.
 - Set desired height to 0.
 - Maintain desired angle.
 - When desired height reaches 0 set duty cycle to 2% and then turn motors off.
